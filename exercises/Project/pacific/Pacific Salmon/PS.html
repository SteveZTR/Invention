  <h2>Habitat</h2>
  <p>Pacific salmon (e.g., Chinook, Coho, Sockeye, Pink, Chum) spend most of their adult lives in the North Pacific Ocean—from California and the U.S. West Coast up through Alaska and across to Asia—but return to freshwater rivers and streams to spawn.</p>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Anadromous life cycle: born in freshwater, mature at sea, return to spawn in rivers</li>
    <li>Distinct species with varied sizes, colors, and run-timing (Chinook, Coho, Sockeye, Pink, Chum)</li>
    <li>Color and body changes during spawning (bright reds, darker heads, hooked jaws in males)</li>
    <li>High ecological importance—supporting predators, nutrients for streams, and Indigenous cultures</li>
    <li>Valued commercially and recreationally (fisheries and subsistence fishing)</li>
  </ul>
