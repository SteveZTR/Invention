    A cathedral of nature’s wonders, the Natural History Museum is alive with fossils, bones, and the geometry of life.
    Morning sunlight dances across its Romanesque arches, illuminating the deep time woven into every exhibit.
    Here, the story of Earth unfolds — stone by stone, feather by feather.
